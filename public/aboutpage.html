        This web application was made for the INST377 Final Deliverable. But besides that, it's meant to serve as a simple application meant to encourage the search of music. 
        And with the capabilities of this website, that can come in the form of researching about someone's favorite band, an album, or a specific track that they enjoy. 
        <br>Additionallly,
        this application gives user's the opportunity to share their favorite music with others in a table. This can also serve as an opportunity for users to learn more about others and 
        their respective interests in music. And perhaps
        offer someone a chance to listen to something new.
            <br>
        The API's used in a majority of this application come from The Audio DB:
